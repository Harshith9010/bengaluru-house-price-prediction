# Bengaluru House Price Prediction 🏠 (Work in Progress)

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict **house prices in Bengaluru** using a Kaggle dataset.  
Currently, I am learning and building this project step by step through **YouTube tutorials + self-exploration**.

## 🚀 Current Progress
- ✅ Data cleaning (handling missing values, feature engineering for location & size)  
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (visualizing distributions, outliers, correlations)  
- 🚧 Model building (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost) – *in progress*  
- 🚧 Model evaluation & tuning – *upcoming*  

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Bengaluru House Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data)  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  

## 📌 Next Steps
- Train multiple ML models and compare performance  
- Hyperparameter tuning for best accuracy  
- Deploy a simple prediction app (Streamlit/Flask)
